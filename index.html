            <h1 id='the_mission'>The Mission</h1>

<p>We want to have a family of clans, a clan network, where members of all ages and levels who are loyal, friendly, and nice can play together. All members will be treated with respect. We want to provide clans with the appropriate troop strength and activeness for all members. Friends from higher level clans can move down to help lower level friends. Friends from lower level clans can move up for a short time to get good troops and visit friends from high level clans. Friendships formed through Clash-of-Clans are easily maintained when friends move up within our clan network. Leaders and elders will move among the clans to foster the camaraderie among clan members.</p>

<h1 id='the_clans'>The Clans</h1>

<p><strong>Currently We have 4 clans:</strong> DragonSlayers-I, <a href='http://bit.ly/dragonslayersjr'>DragonSlayersJr</a>, DragonSlayerJR, SlayersVacation</p>

<p><strong>DragonSlayers-I:</strong> Our most active clan for level 65+ or minimum all troops level 4. During the growing phase of this clan, the minimum donation will be based on the number of members in the clan. Under 20 members: 500; 30+ members: 700; 40+ members: 1000. Low doners will be asked to move to DragonSlayers-II or DragonSlayersJr.</p>

<p><strong>DragonSlayers-II:</strong> <em>(Will form this clan in 1 or 2 months. Require a minimum donation of 400.)</em></p>

<p><strong>DragonSlayersJr:</strong> Our current main clan, and will remain as our main clan until DragonSlayers-II is formed. Level 50+ or minimum archers level 4. Require a minimum donation of 200.</p>

<p><strong>DragonSlayers-III:</strong> <em>(Will form as needed.)</em></p>

<p><strong>DragonSlayerJr:</strong> Members of all levels are welcomed. Minimum donation requirement 100.</p>

<p><strong>NEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Formation of the new clan DragonSlayers-I:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The formation of <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>We will select 8-10 strong/active (not 8-10 best) elders from DragonSlayersJr to form the startup group of DragonSlayers-I</li>

<li>These elders must be the chatty bunch to give the new clan the vibrante/active atmosphere</li>

<li>These elders must give a strong and constant push to help recruit new players for <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong></li>

<li>At the same time we will lower the requirement for <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> to ease with the recruiting of new members to make up for the lost of the 10 strong elders</li>

<li>We will leave good and strong elders in <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> to make sure the clan continue to do well and grow. REMEMBER that <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> is still our <strong>main clan</strong> at this early stage</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Growing both <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong> and <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Elders from both clans will recruit members and send new members to the appropriate clans</li>

<li>To help us grow fast, we will set both clans to &#8220;Anyone can join&#8221; but set the trophies a little higher.</li>

<li>Once a new member join, we will point them to the website and ask them to move to the appropriate clan.</li>

<li>If the new members are not willing to move to the &#8220;lower&#8221; clan, we will let them stay for a few days then the leader will &#8220;kick&#8221; them with the message of asking them to join the appropriate clan.</li>

<li>As DragonSlayersJr growing and reaching 45 members, we will slowly, one by one move qualify active elders to DragonSlayers-I</li>

<li>Qualified elders from <strong>DragonSlayerJR</strong> will be promoted to <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Reaching stability for both clans, <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong> &amp; <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong>, and the creation of <strong>DragonSlayers-II</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If things are going well for both clan, in 1-2 months we should reach 35 stable members in <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong> and 45 members in <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong></li>

<li>If things go well, we should be able to move all qualified elders from <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> to <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong>, at this point, <strong>DragonSlayers-I</strong> will become our <strong>main clan</strong>.</li>

<li>The rest of the active players from <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> will move to another new clan <strong>DragonSlayers-II</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Merging of the remaining of <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> and <strong>DragonSlayerJR</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>We will move all active players from <strong>DragonSlayerJR</strong> to merge with non-active players from <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong>. The non-active players from <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> will provide trophies and body for the clan to help recruit.</li>

<li>The non-active players from <strong>DragonSlayerJR</strong> will be asked (kick) with the message to join <strong>SlayersVacation</strong>. We will no longer have DragonSlayerJR</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> The Creation of DragonSlayers-III</p>

<ol>
<li>Active players from <strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> will move to <strong>DragonSlayer-III</strong></li>

<li><strong>DragonSlayersJr</strong> will be disbanded so we can get rid of the &#8220;Jr&#8221; from our name. If need be, we will create <strong>DragonSlayers-IV</strong> as the entry clan into our clan network</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PREVIOUS WEEK</strong></p>

<p><strong>Active King/Queen Contest</strong></p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> From 12/23/2013 to 1/5/2014</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> All can participate including leader and co-leader</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> To see who are active and who can be the most active</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The most active member who get the highest (DONATED + RECEIVED) in the two weeks period and the Donated:Received ratio is within 1:3 will be crowned Active King/Queen.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The members with the worse ratio than 1:3 are automatically disqualified from the contest.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the event of a tie, which is highly unlikely, the tie breaker will go to the person who have the ratio closest to 1:1 and with a higher donation.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>(We are mindful that this contest is held during the Christmas break in most countries and those who normally active may not be able to participate fully. Likewise, those normally not very active may be able to play more, thus the result of this contest may surprise us all. The main thing is to</em> <strong><em>have fun</em></strong> <em>.)</em></p>

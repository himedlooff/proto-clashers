# The basics

We are a level 60+ clan. We are an active, nice, friendly clan.  Most members have been together for many, many months. We have a good mix of adults and teenagers. Our goal is to provide a fun environment where we can socialize while playing this fun game. We want active players who will chat, request and donate a lot. Currenly we are recruiting players at level 60+. The level of our members are constantly rising, and we will soon raise our level.

Donation Requirement: (subjected to change as our clan grow)

1. Keep your donated to received ratio within 1:3 (1 donation : 3 received)
2. Current minimum donation is 100

Elder Requirement:  (subjected to change as our clan grow)

1. Donate 400 to get promotion from member to elder
2. Donate 300 to remain elder
3. Must maintain 1:3 donate/received ratio to remain elder

# Leaders

- Leader:    Eagles
- Co-leader: Uncharted2000

# How to accept requests

1. The requesting player's level should be 60 or higher.
2. The requesting player's "Friend in Need" total should be their level times 100. For example if the player is level 72 then their "Friend in Need" status should be 7200 or higher.  This is more or less a guide line and not a strict number.
3. Exceptions will be made for player's level in the high 50's with very high "Friend in Need" status.

# Sister/Feeder Clan Information

**DragonSlayerJR** currently accept players of all levels.  (Website TBD)

- Leader: wardogofengland

# How to accept requests

1. The requesting player's level should be 60 or higher.
2. The requesting player's "Friend in need" total should be their level times 100. For example if the player is level 72 then their "Friend in need" status should be 7200 or higher.  This is more or less a guide line and not a strict number.
3. Exception will be made for player's level in the high 50s with very high "Friend in Need" status.
